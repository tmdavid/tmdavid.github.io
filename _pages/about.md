Welcome to my personal website. I'm not sure why you are here, and for how long will you be here, but welcome.
I'm a recurrent genetic applied machine learning engineer. Not to mention how deep convoluted into research I am for my job.

More about me. Profesional/Academic info.
======

I'm currently working at Goldenspear, a fashion company. Seriously, a fashion one. There I develop using fancy Natural Language Processing with/without Deep Learning tools. Some times I dig into computer vision. And even less often I dig into software design, and web design or database stuff. It's a startup, what were you expecting. But enough about me, lets talk about you.....jk, this is my web, if you want to talk about you, get your own, just like I did.

I'm from Barcelona, sunny Barcelona. I got my undergrad in La Salle University, and I kinda enjoyed the ride there, but I moved to Leuven to do my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. During my undergrad I discovered those things called neurons... artificial neurons, you know, the ones that are used to build superhuman emulated deep brains. Since there, I've been in love with the raw power this neural networks have. I'm not sure if we are going to make the world a better place, but hey, it's fun to see the loss curve go down, draw some random samples to test, and then cherry pick the ones that look great to present them as great human advance. Besides that I'm really into trying to understand human language. I, and this is serious, think language is going to be the last barrier to be truly broken by AI, still think we are far away from it. Nonetheless I'm amazed by how we trivialize something as complex as it is language, into a task that we all do with no effort. Sarcasm and irony. That is the great last barrier. 
In Leuven I did a little bit of research in Recurrent Neural Networks, and I kinda felt more in love with them. Now I'm amazed with the seq2seq architecture.

I cited just in case. No troubles, we good here.

Personal info
=========
I have some hobbies, in case you still here. I love to ski, well lately I like more watching great freeride skiers than anything else. I have a great taste in music some might say (specially the ones with same taste). And since I'm catalan, I like to eat, like way too much. I used to play hokey which is a wonderful sport in which only are allowed to play Argetinian, Portuguese, and Catalan people. I mean not allowed but, we good at I meant.
