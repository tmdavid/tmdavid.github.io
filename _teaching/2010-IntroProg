I was an assistant to Introduction to Programming. My main duties were assist to students with their first steps into coding. Not only C coding, but also help them develop a set of skills on how to tackle coding problems, such as helping them to structure the problems they were facing, or help them in designing good enough algorithms or ".h" so that the problem would be solved easily.
